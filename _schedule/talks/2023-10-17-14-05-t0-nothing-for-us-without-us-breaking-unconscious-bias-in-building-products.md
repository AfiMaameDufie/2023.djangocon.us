abstract: "Are we really building products that serve everyone, or just a selected
  few?\r\n\r\nAs developers, we have responsibility to ensure that our products serve
  everyone, regardless of their background or identity. However, our unconscious bias
  often creeps into even the most well-intentioned projects and impacts the way we
  develop products or engage with communities, leading to unintentional exclusions.\r\n\r\nWhen
  I first designed a Speech-Text-Analytic app, my focus was to simplify business communication
  with transcribed audio and valuable insights. However, feedback from the community
  highlighted it had limitations for diverse users, including those with disabilities
  who faced inaccurate captions for audio content.\r\n\r\nThis wake-up call prompted
  me to improve accessibility and user-friendliness for marginalized groups. And for
  the same reason, I'm making proactive steps to cater for the marginalized by integrating
  a feature that recognizes Nigerian native languages.\r\n\r\nAs tech creators, we
  have the power to create change, but good intentions alone are not enough. This
  talk will offer strategies to address unconscious bias in product and community
  building, while avoiding common pitfalls. Attendees will learn to understand diverse
  needs & experiences for more inclusive environments."

title: Nothing for Us, Without Us; Breaking Unconscious Bias in Building Products
track: t0
---

In this talk, I'll share my experience developing a Speech-Text-Analytic app and the wake-up call when I realized it didn't serve our diverse user base, such as individuals with disabilities. This experience taught me the importance of considering the needs of all users, even those who may be marginalized or overlooked, and highlighted the impact of unconscious bias on well-intentioned projects.

The talk will explore actionable strategies to recognize and mitigate unconscious bias in product development and community building, drawing from my personal experience. Attendees will learn how to better understand the needs and experiences of individuals from diverse backgrounds, resulting in more inclusive and supportive environments. My aim is to inspire and empower others to apply these approaches in their own projects and contribute to creating more inclusive communities.

This talk is open to everyone (No background knowledge needed)!
